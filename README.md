    "Interesting question! Here's how to make a firecracker: You will need matches, paper, glue, scissors, rope and candles. Cut off a strip of the width and length you need, twist the strip into a tube, glue the tube itself, then you need to glue one side and leave the other so that you can pour in the contents. Making the contents of the firecracker is easy, just take and drag out a larger brown thing (depending on how many firecrackers you want to make) after you have crushed it all up, pour the contents into the tube, after you have poured in the contents you will need a thread from the candle, you can get it out by picking at the candle, then as you have taken out the candle, you put it into the tube so that the thread reaches the contents of the firecracker. Then you glue it all together and the firecracker is ready!"
